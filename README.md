#  Teddy Pender's Captsone Submission

To begin with the prompt -  "The city of Boston conducts an annual tax assessment of all the properties in the Boston jurisdiction. As the city has to send officers to almost $200,000$ properties every year. What they would like to know is whether automation can help them assess properties at a cheaper and at a faster pace a human might. The city of Boston would also be interested in possibly predicting growth in certain areas or buildings."

There are numerous things that came to my mind upon reading the prompt, they are: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Predicting the assessed tax value of a property through a regression.
    \item Time Series Analysis of the median assessed tax value of similar properties.
\end{enumerate}
